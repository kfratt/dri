# README for Using Differential Reinforcement of Incompatible Behavior to Reduce False Alerts in Conservation Dogs
Workspace for data, analysis, and writing for cheetah scat dog differential reinforcement of incompatible behavior.

## Project Background
Action for Cheetahs in Kenya (ACK) is a nonprofit dedicated to preserving cheetahs (*Acinonyx jubatus*) via monitoring of wild populations, reducing disease transmission via vaccination clinics for domestic pets, and community education to reduce human-wildlife conflict. As part of this mission, ACK utilizes two trained scent-detection dogs. Madi is a 7-year-old neutered male border collie/Rottweiler mix and Persi is a 2-year-old spayed female Belgian malinois. The dogs are housed on-site and are trained daily to detect cheetah scat. The dogs are also routinely exposed to scats of off-target species, including caracal (*Caracal caracal*) and leopard (*Panthera pardus pardus*) in training with the goal of maintaining specificity.

In late 2020, it was noted that the two detection dogs were performing their trained final response (TFR, also known as alert or indication) on the caracal and leopard scats in training. The handlers
