# README for Using Differential Reinforcement of Incompatible Behavior to Reduce Off-Target Alerts in Conservation Dogs
Workspace for data, analysis, and writing for cheetah scat dog differential reinforcement of incompatible behavior.

## Project Background
[Action for Cheetahs in Kenya](https://www.actionforcheetahs.org/) (ACK) is a nonprofit dedicated to preserving cheetahs (*Acinonyx jubatus*) via monitoring of wild populations, reducing disease transmission via vaccination clinics for domestic pets, and community education to reduce human-wildlife conflict. As part of this mission, ACK utilizes two trained scent-detection dogs. Madi is a 7-year-old neutered male border collie/Rottweiler mix and Persi is a 2-year-old spayed female Belgian malinois. The dogs are housed on-site and are trained daily to detect cheetah scat. The dogs are also routinely exposed to scats of off-target species, including caracal (*Caracal caracal*) and leopard (*Panthera pardus pardus*) in training with the goal of maintaining specificity. The dogs were trained to alert to the correct scat by sitting and staring at the scat. This behavior earned them a play session with their handler and a favored toy. 

In late 2020, it was noted that the two detection dogs were performing their alert behavior (also known as trained final response or TFR or indication) on the caracal and leopard scats in training. The handlers responded to these off-target alerts by telling the dog verbally, "No, search on."

Although records do not exist for this period of time, the false alert behavior was not decreasing over time. In March of 2021, teams from [K9 Conservationists](k9conservationists.org) arrived to assist with the training of the ACK detection dog teams and address this concern.

Off-target alerts are costly for conservation organizations due to lost staff time and materials in collecting the scat, freezer space, and laboratory fees for irrelevant samples. When scats are visually difficult for handlers to distinguish, it is imperative that detection dogs maintain specificity. 

To our knowledge, there are no accepted protocols for reducing off-target alerts in detection dogs.

## Questions and Hypotheses
### Is it possible to reduce off-target alerts in detection dogs?

### H1: A differential reinforcement of incompatible behavior procedure will reduce off-target alerts while maintaining correct alerts.
In order to measure this, we needed to video all training sessions with the dogs for independent scoring of correct alerts, off-target alerts, misses, and correct dismissals.
